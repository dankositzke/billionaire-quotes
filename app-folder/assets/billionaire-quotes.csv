Jeff Bezos,"We've had three big ideas at Amazon that we've stuck with for 18 years, and they're the reason we're successful: Put the customer first. Invent. And be patient."
Jeff Bezos,"If you're competitor-focused, you have to wait until there is a competitor doing something. Being customer-focused allows you to be more pioneering."
Jeff Bezos,"All businesses need to be young forever. If your customer ase ages with you, you're Woolworth's."
Jeff Bezos,"There are two kinds of companies, those that work to try to charge more and those that work to charge less. We will be the second."
Jeff Bezos,"If you only do things where you know the answer in advance, your company goes away."
Jeff Bezos,"If you're long-term oriented, customer interests and shareholder interests are aligned."
Jeff Bezos,We are comfortable planting seeds and waiting for them to grow into trees
Jeff Bezos,"There are two ways to extend a business. Take inventory of what you are good at and extend out from your skills. Or determine what your customers need and work backwards, even if it requires learning new skills."
Jeff Bezos,"Friends congratulate me after a quarterly-earnings announcement and say, 'Good job, great quarter.' ""And I'll say, 'Thank you,' but that quarter was baked three years ago."
Jeff Bezos,"Failure and invention are inseparable twins. To invent you have to experiment, and if you know in advance that it's going to work, it's not an experiment."
Jeff Bezos,You have to be willing to be misunderstood if you're going to innovate.
Jeff Bezos,"If you double the number of experiments you do per year, you're going to double your inventiveness."
Jeff Bezos,"To get something new done you have to be stubborn and focused, to the point that others might find unreasonable."
Jeff Bezos,"If you decide that you’re going to do only the things you know are going to work, you’re going to leave a lot of opportunity on the table."
Jeff Bezos,"If you're watching your competitors, you're unlikely to invent a bunch of stuff on your own."
Jeff Bezos,Me-too companies have not done that well over time.
Jeff Bezos,Wandering is an essential counter-balance to efficiency. You need to employ both. The outsized discoveries – the “non-linear” ones – are highly likely to require wandering.
Jeff Bezos,"Staying in Day 1 requires you to experiment patiently, accept failures, plant seeds, protect saplings, and double down when you see customer delight."
Jeff Bezos,"Most decisions should probably be made with somewhere around 70% of the information you wish you had. If you wait for 90%, in most cases, you’re probably being slow."
Jeff Bezos,"To invent you have to experiment, and if you know in advance that it’s going to work, it’s not an experiment. Most large organizations embrace the idea of invention, but are not willing to suffer the string of failed experiments necessary to get there."
Jeff Bezos,"The difference between baseball and business, however, is that baseball has a truncated outcome distribution. When you swing, no matter how well you connect with the ball, the most runs you can get is four. In business, every once in a while, when you step up to the plate, you can score 1,000 runs."
Jeff Bezos,"As a company grows, everything needs to scale, including the size of your failed experiments. If the size of your failures isn’t growing, you’re not going to be inventing at a size that can actually move the needle. Amazon will be experimenting at the right scale for a company of our size if we occasionally have multibillion-dollar failures."
Jeff Bezos,Where you are going to spend your time and your energy is one of the most important decisions you get to make in life.
Jeff Bezos,"The smartest people are constantly revising their understanding, reconsidering a problem they thought they'd already solved. They're open to new points of view, new information, new ideas, contradictions, and challenges to their own way of thinking."
Jeff Bezos,"People who are right a lot listen a lot, and they change their mind a lot. People who are right a lot change their mind without a lot of new data. They wake up and reanalyze things and change their mind. If you don’t change your mind frequently, you’re going to be wrong a lot. People who are right a lot want to disconfirm their fundamental biases."
Jeff Bezos,Life's too short to hang out with people who aren't resourceful.
Jeff Bezos,"In the end, we are our choices. Build yourself a great story."
Jeff Bezos,"We all know that distinctiveness – originality – is valuable. We are all taught to “be yourself.” What I’m really asking you to do is to embrace and be realistic about how much energy it takes to maintain that distinctiveness. The world wants you to be typical – in a thousand ways, it pulls at you. Don’t let it happen."
Jeff Bezos,"We see our customers as invited guests to a party, and we are the hosts. It’s our job every day to make every important aspect of the customer experience a little bit better."
Jeff Bezos,"The best customer service is if the customer doesn’t need to call you, doesn’t need to talk to you. It just works."
Jeff Bezos,We don't focus on the optics of the next quarter; we focus on what is going to be good for customers.
Jeff Bezos,We invent before we have to. These investments are motivated by customer focus rather than by reaction to competition. We think this approach earns more trust with customers and drives rapid improvements in customer experience – importantly – even in those areas where we are already the leader.
Jeff Bezos,"One advantage — perhaps a somewhat subtle one — of a customer-driven focus is that it aids a certain type of proactivity. When we're at our best, we don't wait for external pressures. We are internally driven to improve our services, adding benefits and features, before we have to. We lower prices and increase value for customers before we have to."

Bill Gates,I believe that if you show people the problems and you show them the solutions they will be moved to act.
Bill Gates,"In the long run, your human capital is your main base of competition. Your leading indicator of where you're going to be 20 years from now is how well you're doing in your education system."
Bill Gates,Treatment without prevention is simply unsustainable.
Bill Gates,"Headlines, in a way, are what mislead you because bad news is a headline, and gradual improvement is not."
Bill Gates,I have been struck again and again by how important measurement is to improving the human condition.
Bill Gates,"It’s fine to celebrate success, but it is more important to heed the lessons of failure."
Bill Gates,Success is a lousy teacher. It seduces smart people into thinking they can’t lose.

Bill Gates,"Until we’re educating every kid in a fantastic way, until ever inner city is cleaned up, there is no shortage of things to do."
Bill Gates,"I do think this next century, hopefully, will be about a more global view. Where you don’t just think, ‘Yes, my country is doing well,’ but you think about the world at large."
Bill Gates,"Whether I’m at the office, at home, or on the road, I always have a stack of books I’m looking forward to reading."
Bill Gates,"Don’t compare yourself with anyone in this world. If you do so, you are insulting yourself."
Bill Gates,"I am not in competition with anyone but myself.
My goal is to improve myself continuously."
Bill Gates,"If you give people tools, and they use their natural abilities and their curiosity, they will develop things in ways that will surprise you very much beyond what you might have expected."
Bill Gates,Measuring programming progress by lines of code is like measuring aircraft building progress by weight.
Warren Buffet,There seems to be some perverse human characteristic that likes to make easy things difficult.
Warren Buffet,"I insist on a lot of time being spent, almost every day, to just sit and think. That is very uncommon in American business. I read and think. So I do more reading and thinking, and make less impulse decisions than most people in business. I do it because I like this kind of life."
Warren Buffet,"If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die."
Warren Buffet,"The best investment you can make, is an investment in yourself... The more you learn, the more you'll earn."
Warren Buffet,"Do not save what is left after spending, but spend what is left after saving."
Warren Buffet,We don't have to be smarter than the rest. We have to be more disciplined than the rest.
Warren Buffet,"Look for 3 things in a person. Intelligence, Energy, & Integrity.
If they don't have the last one, don't even bother with the first two."

Warren Buffet,"Time is the friend of the wonderful company, the enemy of the mediocre."
Warren Buffet,Buy a stock the way you would buy a house. Understand and like it such that you’d be content to own it in the absence of any market.
Warren Buffet,"You do things when the opportunities come along. I’ve had periods in my life when I’ve had a bundle of ideas come along, and I’ve had long dry spells. If I get an idea next week, I’ll do something. If not, I won’t do a damn thing."
Warren Buffet,"Opportunities come infrequently. When it rains gold, put out the bucket, not the thimble"
Warren Buffet,You only have to do a very few things right in your life so long as you don’t do too many things wrong.
Warren Buffet,It is not necessary to do extraordinary things to get extraordinary results.
Warren Buffet,"What counts for most people in investing is not how much they know, but rather how realistically they define what they don’t know."
Warren Buffet,"The key to investing is not assessing how much an industry is going to affect society, or how much it will grow, but rather determining the competitive advantage of any given company and, above all, the durability of that advantage."
Warren Buffet,Stocks of companies selling commodity-like products should come with a warning label: ‘Competition may prove hazardous to human wealth.’
Warren Buffet,"Our approach is very much profiting from lack of change rather than from change. With Wrigley chewing gum, it’s the lack of change that appeals to me."
Warren Buffet,Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy only when others are fearful.
Warren Buffet,The most important thing to do if you find yourself in a hole is to stop digging.
Warren Buffet,Risk comes from not knowing what you’re doing.
Warren Buffet,Diversification is a protection against ignorance. It makes very little sense for those who know what they’re doing.
Warren Buffet,"We’ve long felt that the only value of stock forecasters is to make fortune tellers look good. Even now, Charlie and I continue to believe that short-term market forecasts are poison and should be kept locked up in a safe place, away from children and also from grown-ups who behave in the market like children."
Warren Buffet,Forecasts may tell you a great deal about the forecaster; they tell you nothing about the future.
Warren Buffet,Nothing sedates rationality like large doses of effortless money.

never catch it. You always for the most part find out about that stuff too
late. Instead, do what you are really passionate about, what you really
love. That will position you before the wave even hits, and you will find
out about whatever it is before the wave starts, before it gets hot, and that
is how you take advantage."
Elon Musk,"Stop being patient and start asking yourself, how do I accomplish my 10-year plan in 6 months? You will probably fail but you will be a lot further ahead of the person who simply accepted it was going to take 10 years."
