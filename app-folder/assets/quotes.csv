Amazon Leadership Principles,"Customer Obsession - Leaders start with the customer and work backward. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers. "
Amazon Leadership Principles,"Ownership - Leaders are owners. They think long term and don't sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say ""that's not my job."""
Amazon Leadership Principles,"Invent and Simplify - Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by ""not invented here."" As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time."
Amazon Leadership Principles,"Leaders Are Right, a Lot - Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs."
Amazon Leadership Principles,Learn and Be Curious - Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them.
Amazon Leadership Principles,"Hire and Develop the Best - Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognize exceptional talent, and willingly move them throughout the organization. Leaders develop leaders and take seriously their role in coaching others. We work on behalf of our people to invent mechanisms for development like Career Choice."
Amazon Leadership Principles,"Insist on the Highest Standards - Leaders have relentlessly high standards; many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders are continually raising the bar and drive their teams to deliver high-quality products, services, and processes. Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed."
Amazon Leadership Principles,Think Big - Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.
Amazon Leadership Principles,Bias for Action - Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk taking.
Amazon Leadership Principles,"Frugality - Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency, and invention. There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size, or fixed expense."
Amazon Leadership Principles,"Earn Trust - Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing. Leaders do not believe their or their team's body odor smells of perfume. They benchmark themselves and their teams against the best."
Amazon Leadership Principles,"Dive Deep - Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ. No task is beneath them."
Amazon Leadership Principles,"Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit - Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly."
Amazon Leadership Principles,"Deliver Results - Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. Despite setbacks, they rise to the occasion and never settle."
Bill Gates,The first rule of any technology used in a business is that automation applied to an efficient operation will magnify the efficiency. The second is that automation applied to an inefficient operation will magnify the inefficiency.
Bill Gates,Your most unhappy customers are your greatest source of learning.
Bill Gates,We always overestimate the change that will occur in the next two years and underestimate the change that will occur in the next ten. Don't let yourself be lulled into inaction.
Bill Gates,"The advance of technology is based on making it fit in so that you don't really even notice it, so it's part of everyday life."
Bill Gates,"As we look ahead into the next century, leaders will be those who empower others."
Bill Gates,Information technology and business are becoming inextricably interwoven. I don't think anybody can talk meaningfully about one without the talking about the other.
Bill Gates,Intellectual property has the shelf life of a banana.
Bill Gates,I believe in innovation and that the way you get innovation is you fund research and you learn the basic facts.
Bill Gates,I believe that if you show people the problems and you show them the solutions they will be moved to act.
Bill Gates,"In the long run, your human capital is your main base of competition. Your leading indicator of where you're going to be 20 years from now is how well you're doing in your education system."
Bill Gates,Treatment without prevention is simply unsustainable.
Bill Gates,"Headlines, in a way, are what mislead you because bad news is a headline, and gradual improvement is not."
Bill Gates,I have been struck again and again by how important measurement is to improving the human condition.
Bill Gates,"It's fine to celebrate success, but it is more important to heed the lessons of failure."
Bill Gates,Success is a lousy teacher. It seduces smart people into thinking they can't lose.
Bill Gates,"Of my mental cycles, I devote maybe 10% to business thinking. Business isn't that complicated."
Bill Gates,We all need people who will give us feedback. That's how we improve.
Bill Gates,Our success has really been based on partnerships from the very beginning.
Bill Gates,"Until we're educating every kid in a fantastic way, until ever inner city is cleaned up, there is no shortage of things to do."
Bill Gates,"I do think this next century, hopefully, will be about a more global view. Where you don't just think, 'Yes, my country is doing well,' but you think about the world at large."
Bill Gates,"Whether I'm at the office, at home, or on the road, I always have a stack of books I'm looking forward to reading."
Bill Gates,"Don't compare yourself with anyone in this world. If you do so, you are insulting yourself."
Bill Gates,"I am not in competition with anyone but myself.
My goal is to improve myself continuously."
Bill Gates,"If you give people tools, and they use their natural abilities and their curiosity, they will develop things in ways that will surprise you very much beyond what you might have expected."
Bill Gates,Measuring programming progress by lines of code is like measuring aircraft building progress by weight.
Elon Musk,"When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor."
Elon Musk,What makes innovative thinking happen?... I think it's really a mindset. You have to decide.
Elon Musk,"If you're trying to create a company, it's like baking a cake. You have to have all the ingredients in the right proportion."
Elon Musk,"I think it's very important to have a feedback loop, where you're constantly thinking about what you've done and how you could be doing it better. I think that's the single best piece of advice: constantly think about how you could be doing things better and questioning yourself."
Elon Musk,People work better when they know what the goal is and why. It is important that people look forward to coming to work in the morning and enjoy working.
Elon Musk,Great companies are built on great products.
Elon Musk,Any product that needs a manual to work is broken.
Elon Musk,"I don't create companies for the sake of creating companies, but to get things done."
Elon Musk,There are really two things that have to occur in order for a new technology to be affordable to the mass market. One is you need economies of scale. The other is you need to iterate on the design. You need to go through a few versions.
Elon Musk,"I'm interested in things that change the world or that affect the future and wondrous, new technology where you see it, and you're like, 'Wow, how did that even happen? How is that possible?'"
Elon Musk,"We realized that the true problem, the true difficulty, and where the greatest potential is - is building the machine that makes the machine. In other words, it's building the factory. I'm really thinking of the factory like a product."
Elon Musk,"It is important to view knowledge as sort of a semantic tree - make sure you understand the fundamental principles, ie the trunk and big branches, before you get into the leaves/details or there is nothing for them to hang on to."
Elon Musk,You should take the approach that you're wrong. Your goal is to be less wrong.
Elon Musk,You get paid in direct proportion to the difficulty of problems you solve
Elon Musk,Constantly seek criticism. A well thought out critique of whatever you're doing is as valuable as gold.
Elon Musk,"The first step is to establish that something is possible, then probability will occur."
Elon Musk,"One of the biggest mistakes we made was trying to automate things that are super easy for a person to do, but super hard for a robot to do."
Elon Musk,Life needs to be more than just solving problems every day. You need to wake up and be excited about the future.
Elon Musk,Education is basically downloading data and algorithms into your brain.
Elon Musk,"One of the really tough things is figuring out what questions to ask. Once you figure out the question, then the answer is relatively easy"
Elon Musk,With automation comes abundance.
Elon Musk,"Never chase the next hot thing. Stop trying to chase the wave. You will
never catch it. You always for the most part find out about that stuff too
late. Instead, do what you are really passionate about, what you really
love. That will position you before the wave even hits, and you will find
out about whatever it is before the wave starts, before it gets hot, and that
is how you take advantage."
Elon Musk,"Stop being patient and start asking yourself, how do I accomplish my 10-year plan in 6 months? You will probably fail but you will be a lot further ahead of the person who simply accepted it was going to take 10 years."
Elon Musk,"Some people don't like change, but you need to embrace change if the alternative is disaster."
Elon Musk,I don't think it's a good idea to plan to sell a company.
Elon Musk,"It is a mistake to hire huge numbers of people to get a complicated job done. Numbers will never compensate for talent in getting the right answer (two people who don't know something are no better than one), will tend to slow down progress, and will make the task incredibly expensive."
Elon Musk,"A company is a group organized to create a product or service, and it is only as good as its people and how excited they are about creating."
Elon Musk,"If you're co-founder or CEO, you have to do all kinds of tasks you might not want to do... If you don't do your chores, the company won't succeed... No task is too menial."
Elon Musk,I always invest my own money in the companies that I create. I don't believe in the whole thing of just using other people's money. I don't think that's right. I'm not going to ask other people to invest in something if I'm not prepared to do so myself.
Elon Musk,"Talent is extremely important. It's like a sports team, the team that has the best individual player will often win, but then there's a multiplier from how those players work together and the strategy they employ."
Elon Musk,You shouldn't do things differently just because they're different. They need to be... better.
Elon Musk,"I think the best way to attract venture capital is to try and come up with a demonstration of whatever product or service it is and ideally take that as far as you can. Just see if you can sell that to real customers and start generating some momentum. The further along you can get with that, the more likely you are to get funding."
Elon Musk,"If something has to be designed and invented, and you have to figure out how to ensure that the value of the thing you create is greater than the cost of the inputs, then that is probably my core skill."
Elon Musk,"I always have optimism, but I'm realistic. It was not with the expectation of great success that I started Tesla or SpaceX... It's just that I thought they were important enough to do anyway."
Henry Ford,"Anyone who stops learning is old, whether at twenty or eighty. Anyone who keeps learning stays young. The greatest thing in life is to keep your mind young."
Henry Ford,"Failure is simply the opportunity to begin again, this time more intelligently."
Henry Ford,"If you think you can do a thing or think you can't do a thing, you're right."
Henry Ford,Obstacles are those frightful things you see when you take your eyes off your goal.
Henry Ford,"Thinking is the hardest work there is, which is probably the reason why so few engage in it."
Henry Ford,"If there is any one secret of success, it lies in the ability to get the other person's point of view and see things from that person's angle as well as from your own."
Henry Ford,You can't build a reputation on what you are going to do.
Henry Ford,It is not the employer who pays the wages. Employers only handle the money. It is the customer who pays the wages.
Henry Ford,Nothing is particularly hard if you divide it into small jobs.
Henry Ford,It has been my observation that most people get ahead during the time that others waste.
Henry Ford,I am looking for a lot of men who have an infinite capacity to not know what can't be done.
Henry Ford,A business absolutely devoted to service will have only one worry about profits. They will be embarrassingly large.
Henry Ford,Most people spend more time and energy going around problems than in trying to solve them.
Henry Ford,"Before everything else, getting ready is the secret of success."
Henry Ford,"The man who will use his skill and constructive imagination to see how much he can give for a dollar, instead of how little he can give for a dollar, is bound to succeed."
Henry Ford,"The competitor to be feared is one who never bothers about you at all, but goes on making his own business better all the time."
Henry Ford,There is no man living that can not do more than he thinks he can.
Henry Ford,"Wealth, like happiness, is never attained when sought after directly. It comes as a by-product of providing a useful service."
Henry Ford,"There is one rule for the industrialist and that is: Make the best quality of goods possible at the lowest cost possible, paying the highest wages possible."
Henry Ford,"Competition is the keen cutting edge of business, always shaving away at costs."
Henry Ford,I cannot discover that anyone knows enough to say definitely what is and what is not possible.
Jack Dorsey,Meet customers where they are; question how to make the tools customers use more valuable.
Jack Dorsey,Great companies don't just have one founding moment. They have many founding moments.
Jack Dorsey,It's really complex to make something simple.
Jack Dorsey,"Everyone has an idea, but it's really about executing the idea and attracting other people to help you with the idea."
Jack Dorsey,Build what you want to see in the world.
Jack Dorsey,We get to design what we want to see in the world rather than doing what other people think should be done.
Jack Dorsey,You don't have to start from scratch to have a massive impact on the world. You have to have a good idea. You have to convince other people of those good ideas. And you have to push as quickly as possible.
Jack Dorsey,Make every detail perfect and limit the number of details to perfect.
Jack Dorsey,"The greatest lesson that I learned in all of this is that you have to start. Start now, start here, and start small. Keep it simple."
Jack Dorsey,"A founder is not a job, it's a role, an attitude"
Jeff Bezos,"We've had three big ideas at Amazon that we've stuck with for 18 years, and they're the reason we're successful: Put the customer first. Invent. And be patient."
Jeff Bezos,"If you're competitor-focused, you have to wait until there is a competitor doing something. Being customer-focused allows you to be more pioneering."
Jeff Bezos,"All businesses need to be young forever. If your customer base ages with you, you're Woolworth's."
Jeff Bezos,"There are two kinds of companies, those that work to try to charge more and those that work to charge less. We will be the second."
Jeff Bezos,"If you only do things where you know the answer in advance, your company goes away."
Jeff Bezos,"If you're long-term oriented, customer interests and shareholder interests are aligned."
Jeff Bezos,We are comfortable planting seeds and waiting for them to grow into trees
Jeff Bezos,"There are two ways to extend a business. Take inventory of what you are good at and extend out from your skills. Or determine what your customers need and work backwards, even if it requires learning new skills."
Jeff Bezos,"Friends congratulate me after a quarterly-earnings announcement and say, 'Good job, great quarter.' ""And I'll say, 'Thank you,' but that quarter was baked three years ago."
Jeff Bezos,"Failure and invention are inseparable twins. To invent you have to experiment, and if you know in advance that it's going to work, it's not an experiment."
Jeff Bezos,You have to be willing to be misunderstood if you're going to innovate.
Jeff Bezos,"If you double the number of experiments you do per year, you're going to double your inventiveness."
Jeff Bezos,"To get something new done you have to be stubborn and focused, to the point that others might find unreasonable."
Jeff Bezos,"If you decide that you're going to do only the things you know are going to work, you're going to leave a lot of opportunity on the table."
Jeff Bezos,"If you're watching your competitors, you're unlikely to invent a bunch of stuff on your own."
Jeff Bezos,Me-too companies have not done that well over time.
Jeff Bezos,"Wandering is an essential counter-balance to efficiency. You need to employ both. The outsized discoveries - the ""non-linear"" ones - are highly likely to require wandering."
Jeff Bezos,"Staying in Day 1 requires you to experiment patiently, accept failures, plant seeds, protect saplings, and double down when you see customer delight."
Jeff Bezos,"Most decisions should probably be made with somewhere around 70% of the information you wish you had. If you wait for 90%, in most cases, you're probably being slow."
Jeff Bezos,"To invent you have to experiment, and if you know in advance that it's going to work, it's not an experiment. Most large organizations embrace the idea of invention, but are not willing to suffer the string of failed experiments necessary to get there."
Jeff Bezos,"The difference between baseball and business, however, is that baseball has a truncated outcome distribution. When you swing, no matter how well you connect with the ball, the most runs you can get is four. In business, every once in a while, when you step up to the plate, you can score 1,000 runs."
Jeff Bezos,"As a company grows, everything needs to scale, including the size of your failed experiments. If the size of your failures isn't growing, you're not going to be inventing at a size that can actually move the needle. Amazon will be experimenting at the right scale for a company of our size if we occasionally have multibillion-dollar failures."
Jeff Bezos,Where you are going to spend your time and your energy is one of the most important decisions you get to make in life.
Jeff Bezos,"The smartest people are constantly revising their understanding, reconsidering a problem they thought they'd already solved. They're open to new points of view, new information, new ideas, contradictions, and challenges to their own way of thinking."
Jeff Bezos,"People who are right a lot listen a lot, and they change their mind a lot. People who are right a lot change their mind without a lot of new data. They wake up and reanalyze things and change their mind. If you don't change your mind frequently, you're going to be wrong a lot. People who are right a lot want to disconfirm their fundamental biases."
Jeff Bezos,Life's too short to hang out with people who aren't resourceful.
Jeff Bezos,"In the end, we are our choices. Build yourself a great story."
Jeff Bezos,"We all know that distinctiveness - originality - is valuable. We are all taught to ""be yourself."" What I'm really asking you to do is to embrace and be realistic about how much energy it takes to maintain that distinctiveness. The world wants you to be typical - in a thousand ways, it pulls at you. Don't let it happen."
Jeff Bezos,"We see our customers as invited guests to a party, and we are the hosts. It's our job every day to make every important aspect of the customer experience a little bit better."
Jeff Bezos,"The best customer service is if the customer doesn't need to call you, doesn't need to talk to you. It just works."
Jeff Bezos,We don't focus on the optics of the next quarter; we focus on what is going to be good for customers.
Jeff Bezos,We invent before we have to. These investments are motivated by customer focus rather than by reaction to competition. We think this approach earns more trust with customers and drives rapid improvements in customer experience - importantly - even in those areas where we are already the leader.
Jeff Bezos,"One advantage -- perhaps a somewhat subtle one -- of a customer-driven focus is that it aids a certain type of proactivity. When we're at our best, we don't wait for external pressures. We are internally driven to improve our services, adding benefits and features, before we have to. We lower prices and increase value for customers before we have to."
Jeff Bezos,Maintain a firm grasp of the obvious at all times
Jeff Bezos,We believe that focusing our energy on the controllable inputs to our business is the most effective way to maximize financial outputs over time.
Jeff Bezos,"In some large companies, it might be difficult to grow new businesses from tiny seeds because of the patience and nurturing required. In my view, Amazon's culture is unusually supportive of small businesses with big potential, and I believe that's a source of competitive advantage."
Jeff Bezos,We are doubly-blessed. We have a market-size unconstrained opportunity in an area where the underlying foundational technology we employ improves every day. That is not normal.
Jeff Bezos,"A dreamy business product has at least four characteristics. Customers love it, it can grow to very large size, it has strong returns on capital, and it's durable in time--with the potential to endure for decades. When you find one of these, don't just swipe right, get married."
Jeff Bezos,How do you stay ahead of ever-rising customer expectations? There's no single way to do it -- it's a combination of many things. But high standards (widely deployed and at all levels of detail) are certainly a big part of it.
Jeff Bezos,"And while many of our systems are based on the latest in computer science research, this often hasn't been sufficient: our architects and engineers have had to advance research in directions that no academic had yet taken. Many of the problems we face have no textbook solutions, and so we -- happily -- invent new approaches."
Jeff Bezos,"This decentralized distribution of invention throughout the company -- not limited to the company's senior leaders -- is the only way to get robust, high-throughput innovation."
Jeff Bezos,"Our customers have made our business what it is, they are the ones with whom we have a relationship, and they are the ones to whom we owe a great obligation. And we consider them to be loyal to us -- right up until the second that someone else offers them a better service."
Jeff Bezos,"Unrealistic beliefs on scope - often hidden and undiscussed - kill high standards. To achieve high standards yourself or as part of a team, you need to form and proactively communicate realistic beliefs about how hard something is going to be"
Jeff Bezos,...You can improve results through the simple act of teaching scope - that a great memo probably should take a week or more.
Jeff Bezos,"We will continue to focus on hiring and retaining versatile and talented employees, and continue to
weight their compensation to stock options rather than cash. We know our success will be largely affected by our ability to attract and retain a motivated employee base, each of whom must think like, and therefore must actually be, an owner."
Jeff Bezos,"Word of mouth remains the most powerful customer acquisition tool we have, and we are grateful for the trust our customers have placed in us."
Jeff Bezos,"We will make bold rather than timid investment decisions where we see a sufficient probability of gaining market leadership advantages. Some of these investments will pay off, others will not, and we will have learned another valuable lesson in either case."
Jeff Bezos,"We first measure ourselves in terms of the metrics most
indicative of our market leadership: customer and revenue growth, the degree to which our customers continue to
purchase from us on a repeat basis, and the strength of our brand. We have invested and will continue to invest aggressively to expand and leverage our customer base, brand, and infrastructure as we move to establish an enduring franchise."
Jeff Bezos,We believe that a fundamental measure of our success will be the shareholder value we create over the long term. This value will be a direct result of our ability to extend and solidify our current market leadership position.
Jeff Bezos,"Staying in Day 1 requires you to experiment patiently, accept failures, plant seeds, protect saplings, and double down when you see customer delight. A customer-obsessed culture best creates the conditions where all of that can happen."
Jeff Bezos,"The outside world can push you into Day 2 if you won't or can't embrace powerful trends quickly. If you fight them, you're probably fighting the future. Embrace them and you have a tailwind."
Jeff Bezos,"If you're good at course correcting, being wrong may be less costly than you think, whereas being slow is going to be expensive for sure."
Jeff Bezos,"It's critical to ask customers what they want, listen carefully to their answers, and figure out a plan to provide it thoughtfully and quickly (speed matters in business!). No business could thrive without that kind of customer obsession. But it's also not enough. The biggest needle movers will be things that customers don't know to ask for. We must invent on their behalf. We have to tap into our own inner imagination about what's possible."
Jeff Bezos,"Turns out the world was in fact ready and hungry for an offering like AWS but didn't know it. We had a hunch, followed our curiosity, took the necessary financial risks, and began building - reworking, experimenting, and iterating countless times as we proceeded."
Jeff Bezos,"Most large organizations embrace the idea of invention, but are not willing to suffer the string of failed experiments necessary to get there."
Jeff Bezos,"Given a ten percent chance of a 100 times payoff, you should take that bet every time. But you're still going to be wrong nine times out of ten."
Jeff Bezos,"In business, every once in a while, when you step up to the plate, you can score 1,000 runs. This long-tailed distribution of returns is why it's important to be bold. Big winners pay for so many experiments."
Jeff Bezos,"We took two big swings and missed - with Auctions and zShops - before we launched Marketplace over 15 years ago. We learned from our failures and stayed stubborn on the vision, and today close to 50% of units sold on Amazon are sold by third-party sellers. "
Jeff Bezos,"We want to be a large company that's also an invention machine. We want to combine the extraordinary customer-serving capabilities that are enabled by size with the speed of movement, nimbleness, and risk-acceptance mentality normally associated with entrepreneurial start-ups."
Jeff Bezos,"We challenge ourselves to not only invent outward facing features, but also to find better ways to do things internally - things that will both make us more effective and benefit our thousands of employees around the world."
Jeff Bezos,"In the long-run, an employee staying somewhere they don't want to be isn't healthy for the employee or the company."
Jeff Bezos,"We have our own internal experimentation platform called ""Weblab"" that we use to evaluate improvements to our websites and products. In 2013, we ran 1,976 Weblabs worldwide, up from 1,092 in 2012, and 546 in 2011."
Jeff Bezos,"Nothing gives us more pleasure at Amazon than ""reinventing normal"" - creating inventions that customers love and resetting their expectations for what normal should be."
Jeff Bezos,"We have the good fortune of a large, inventive team and a patient, pioneering, customer-obsessed culture - great innovations, large and small, are happening everyday on behalf of customers, and at all levels throughout the company. This decentralized distribution of invention throughout the company - not limited to the company's senior leaders - is the only way to get robust, high-throughput innovation."
Jeff Bezos,We lower prices and increase value for customers before we have to. We invent before we have to. These investments are motivated by customer focus rather than by reaction to competition. We think this approach earns more trust with customers and drives rapid improvements in customer experience - importantly - even in those areas where we are already the leader.
Jeff Bezos,...Our energy at Amazon comes from the desire to impress customers rather than the zeal to best competitors.
Jeff Bezos,"One industry observer recently received an automated email from us that said, ""We noticed that you experienced poor video playback while watching the following rental on Amazon Video On Demand: Casablanca. We're sorry for the inconvenience and have issued you a refund for the following amount: $2.99. We hope to see you again soon."""
Jeff Bezos,Our business approach is to sell premium hardware at roughly breakeven prices. We want to make money when people use our devices - not when people buy our devices. We think this aligns us better with customers.
Jeff Bezos,"Take a long-term view, and the interests of customers and shareholders align."
Jeff Bezos,We don't celebrate a 10% increase in the stock price like we celebrate excellent customer experience. We aren't 10% smarter when that happens and conversely aren't 10% dumber when the stock goes the other way.
Jeff Bezos,"When a platform is self-service, even the improbable ideas can get tried, because there's no expert gatekeeper ready to say ""that will never work!"" And guess what - many of those improbable ideas do work, and society is the beneficiary of that diversity."
Jeff Bezos,"...While many of our systems are based on the latest in computer science research, this often hasn't been sufficient: our architects and engineers have had to advance research in directions that no academic had yet taken. Many of the problems we face have no textbook solutions, and so we -- happily -- invent new approaches"

John D Rockefeller,Nobody does anything if he can get anybody else to do it
John D Rockefeller,A man of words and not of deeds is like a garden full of weeds.
John D Rockefeller,Do not many of us who fail to achieve big things ... fail because we lack concentration -- the art of concentrating the mind on the thing to be done at the proper time and to the exclusion of everything else?
John D Rockefeller,Competition is a sin.
John D Rockefeller,Think of giving not as a duty but as a privilege.
John D Rockefeller,"The road to happiness lies in two simple principles; find what it is that interests you and that you can do well, and when you find it put your whole soul into it every bit of energy and ambition and natural ability you have."

John D Rockefeller,"It is worthwhile to emphasize again the fact that it is not merely capital and ""plants"" and the strictly material things which make up a business, but the character of the men behind these things, their personalities, and their abilities; these are the essentials to be reckoned with."
John D Rockefeller,"In the choice of your profession or your business employment, let your first thought be: Where can I fit in so that I may be most effective in the work of the world? Where can I lend a hand in a way most effectively to advance the general interests?"
John D Rockefeller,It is remarkable how many men overlook what should be the obvious
John D Rockefeller,Don't even think of temporary or sharp advantages. Don't waste your effort on a thing which ends in a petty triumph unless you are satisfied with a life of petty success. Be sure that before you go into an enterprise you see your way clear to stay through to a successful end. Look ahead.
John D Rockefeller,"I admire persistence. It is commendable, especially in young men, and it wil win in the end."
John D Rockefeller,"Do not be discouraged... I had many refusals, I did not give up."
Larry Page,"If you're changing the world, you're working on important things. You're excited to get up in the morning."
Larry Page,"My job as a leader is to make sure everybody in the company has great opportunities, and that they feel they're having a meaningful impact and are contributing to the good of society. As a world, we're doing a better job of that. My goal is for Google to lead, not follow that."
Larry Page,"Invention is not enough. Tesla invented the electric power we use, but he struggled to get it out to people. You have to combine both things: invention and innovation focus, plus the company that can commercialize things and get them to people."
Larry Page,Lots of companies don't succeed over time. What do they fundamentally do wrong? They usually miss the future.
Larry Page,"Especially in technology, we need revolutionary change, not incremental change."
Larry Page,"The ultimate search engine would basically understand everything in the world, and it would always give you the right thing. And we're a long, long ways from that."
Larry Page,"I think it is often easier to make progress on mega-ambitious dreams. Since no one else is crazy enough to do it, you have little competition. In fact, there are so few people this crazy that I feel like I know them all by first name."
Larry Page,"We want to build technology that everybody loves using, and that affects everyone. We want to create beautiful, intuitive services and technologies that are so incredibly useful that people use them twice a day. Like they use a toothbrush. There aren't that many things people use twice a day."
Larry Page,"You need to invent things and you need to get them to people. You need to commercialize those inventions. Obviously, the best way we've come up with doing that is through companies."
Larry Page,Small groups of people can have a really huge impact.
Larry Page,"If you say you want to automate cars and save people's lives, the skills you need for that aren't taught in any particular discipline. I know - I was interested in working on automating cars when I was a Ph.D. student in 1995."
Larry Page,Have a healthy disregard for the impossible.
Larry Page,Always deliver more than expected.
Larry Page,"If you're not doing some things that are crazy, then you're doing the wrong things."
Larry Page,"If you have a product that's really gaining a lot of usage, then it's probably a good idea."
Larry Page,It's very hard to fail completely if you aim high enough.
Larry Page,"For a lot of companies, it's useful for them to feel like they have an obvious competitor and to rally around that. I personally believe it's better to shoot higher. You don't want to be looking at your competitors. You want to be looking at what's possible and how to make the world better"
Larry Page,Optimism is important. You have to be a little silly about the goals you are going to set. You should try to do things that most people would not do.
Larry Page,"Anything you can imagine probably is doable, you just have to imagine it and work on it."
Larry Page,"Excellence matters. I've pushed hard to increase our velocity, improve our execution, and focus on the big bets that will make a difference in the world."
Larry Page,Any conversation I have about innovation starts with the ultimate goal.
Larry Page,Solving big problems is easier than solving little ones.
Larry Page,"Coming up with an idea is the least important part of creating something great. It has to be the right idea and have good taste, but the execution and delivery are what's key."
Larry Page,I want to push the envelope for what's possible for an innovative company with large resources.
Mark Zuckerberg,"The question I ask myself like almost every day is, 'Am I doing the most important thing I could be doing?'"
Mark Zuckerberg,"People don't care about what you say, they care about what you build. And if you can make something that makes people's life better, then that's something that's really good."
Mark Zuckerberg,I'm here to build something for the long-term. Anything else is a distraction.
Mark Zuckerberg,"I think as a company, if you can get those two things right-having a clear direction on what you are trying to do and bringing in great people who can execute on the stuff-then you can do pretty well."
Mark Zuckerberg,People think innovation is just having a good idea but a lot of it is just moving quickly and trying a lot of things.
Mark Zuckerberg,You are better off trying something and having it not work and learning from that than not doing anything at all.
Mark Zuckerberg,"In terms of doing work and in terms of learning and evolving as a person, you just grow more when you get more people's perspectives"
Mark Zuckerberg,One of things that I do focus on at Facebook is making sure the culture is very friendly and that people hang out. So instead of having 20% of people's time working on projects I make people hang out with each other.
Mark Zuckerberg,"I made so many mistakes in running the company so far, basically any mistake you can think of I probably made. I think, if anything, the Facebook story is a great example of how if you're building a product that people love you can make a lot of mistakes"
Mark Zuckerberg,"People can be really smart or have skills that are directly applicable, but if they don't really believe in it, then they are not going to really work hard."
Mark Zuckerberg,Don't let anyone tell you to change who you are.
Mark Zuckerberg,Books allow you to fully explore a topic and immerse yourself in a deeper way than most media today.
Mark Zuckerberg,"Some people dream of success, while others wake up and work hard at it."
Michael Dell,"Every breakthrough business idea begins with solving a common problem. The bigger the problem, the bigger the opportunity. I discovered a big one when I took apart an IBM PC. I made two interesting discoveries: The components were all manufactured by other companies, and the system that retailed for $3,000 cost about $600 in parts."
Michael Dell,"The best customers for us are the ones that present us with a new problem because chances are, if one customer has that problem, 100 more have it, or 1,000, or 10,000. So you start thinking about solution development rather than product development."
Michael Dell,Ignore the people who tell you it won't work and hire people who embrace your vision.
Michael Dell,"If you want to sustain excellence over a long time, you'd better come up with a system that works well. Anyone can sprint for a little while, but you can't sprint for forty years."
Michael Dell,"I believe that you have to understand the economics of a business before you have a strategy, and you have to understand your strategy before you have a structure. If you get these in the wrong order, you will probably fail."
Michael Dell,"We are all gifts to each other, and my own growth as a leader has shown me again and again that the most rewarding experiences come from my relationships."
Michael Dell,"As you start your journey, the first thing you should do is throw away that store-bought map and begin to draw your own."
Michael Dell,"We've found that customers are very open. They'll tell you what's going on, what's working and what's not. They're looking for help."
Michael Dell,"By questioning all the aspects of our business, we continuously inject improvement and innovation into our culture."
Phil Knight,"When you see only problems, you're not seeing clearly."
Phil Knight,Beating the competition is relatively easy. Beating yourself is a never-ending commitment.
Phil Knight,History is one long processional of crazy ideas.
Phil Knight,"I refused to even consider ordering less inventory. Grow or die, that's what I believed, no matter the situation."
Phil Knight,"What if there were a way, without being an athlete, to feel what athletes feel? To play all the time, instead of working? Or else to enjoy work so much that it becomes essentially the same thing."
Phil Knight,So that morning in 1962 I told myself: Let everyone else call your idea crazy . . . just keep going. Don't stop. Don't even think about stopping until you get there
Phil Knight,"If my life was to be all work no play, I wanted my work to be play."
Phil Knight,"Whatever pleasures or gains you derive from the act of running, you must find them within. It's all in how you frame it, how you sell it to yourself."
Phil Knight,"I had an aching sense that our time is short, shorter than we ever know, short as a morning run, and I wanted mine to be meaningful. And purposeful. And creative. And important. Above all... different."
Phil Knight,"Don't tell people how to do things, tell them what to do and let them surprise you with their results."
Phil Knight,Any building is a temple if you make it so.
Phil Knight,The man who moves a mountain begins by carrying away small stones
Phil Knight,"Dare to take chances, lest you leave your talent buried in the ground."
Phil Knight,"Play by the rules, but be ferocious."
Ray Dalio,Listening to uninformed people is worse than having no answers at all.
Ray Dalio,Choose your habits well. Habit is probably the most powerful tool in your brain's toolbox.
Ray Dalio,"Truth - more precisely, an accurate understanding of reality - is the essential foundation for producing good outcomes."
Ray Dalio,"If you can't successfully do something, don't think you can tell others how it should be done."
Ray Dalio,"I learned that if you work hard and creatively, you can have just about anything you want, but not everything you want. Maturity is the ability to reject good alternatives in order to pursue even better ones."
Ray Dalio,"Success comes from knowing what you don't know, more than coming from what you do know."
Ray Dalio,"If you don't look at yourself and think, 'Wow how stupid I was a year ago,' then you must not have learned much in the last year."
Ray Dalio,Don't just pay attention to your job; pay attention to how your job will be done if you are no longer around.
Ray Dalio,I just want to be right - I don't care if the right answer comes from me.
Ray Dalio,Pain + Reflection = Progress
Ray Dalio,The greatest gift you can give someone is the power to be successful. Giving people the opportunity to struggle rather than giving them the things they are struggling for will make them stronger.
Ray Dalio,"I saw that to do exceptionally well you have to push your limits and that, if you push your limits, you will crash and it will hurt a lot. You will think you have failed--but that won't be true unless you give up."
Ray Dalio,"If you are not aggressive, you are not going to make money, and if you are not defensive, you are not going to keep money."
Ray Dalio,Most of life's greatest opportunities come out of moments of struggle; it's up to you to make the most of these tests of creativity and character.
Ray Dalio,It's more important to do big things well than to do the small things perfectly.
Ray Dalio,Not being controlled by an emotion helps to see things at a higher level.
Ray Dalio,Mistakes are the path to progress.
Ray Dalio,"The more you think you know, the more close-minded you'll be."
Ray Dalio,"More than anything else, what differentiates people who live up to their potential from those who don't is a willingness to look at themselves and others objectively."
Ray Dalio,Remember that weaknesses don't matter if you find solutions.
Ray Dalio,"Because our educational system is hung up on precision, the art of being good at approximations is insufficiently valued."
Ray Dalio,"Remember that in great partnerships, consideration and generosity are more important than money."
Ray Dalio,Don't mistake possibilities for probabilities. Anything is possible. It's the probabilities that matter. Everything must be weighed in terms of its likelihood and prioritized.
Ray Dalio,"For every mistake that you learn from, you will save thousands of similar mistakes in the future, so if you treat mistakes as learning opportunities that yield rapid improvements you should be excited by them. But if you treat them as bad things, you will make yourself and others miserable, and you won't grow."
Ray Dalio,The greatest tragedy of mankind is people who have opinions that are wrong.
Ray Dalio,"I believe that all organizations basically have two types of people: those who work to be part of a mission, and those who work for a paycheck."
Ray Dalio,"People with good work habits have to-do lists that are reasonably prioritized, and they make themselves do what needs to be done."
Ray Dalio,Every game has principles that successful players master to achieve winning results. So does life.
Ray Dalio,Look at what caused people to make a lot of money and you will see that usually it is in proportion to their production of what the society wanted.
Warren Buffet,There seems to be some perverse human characteristic that likes to make easy things difficult.
Warren Buffet,"I insist on a lot of time being spent, almost every day, to just sit and think. That is very uncommon in American business. I read and think. So I do more reading and thinking, and make less impulse decisions than most people in business. I do it because I like this kind of life."
Warren Buffet,"If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die."
Warren Buffet,"The best investment you can make, is an investment in yourself... The more you learn, the more you'll earn."
Warren Buffet,"Do not save what is left after spending, but spend what is left after saving."
Warren Buffet,We don't have to be smarter than the rest. We have to be more disciplined than the rest.
Warren Buffet,"Look for 3 things in a person. Intelligence, Energy, & Integrity.
If they don't have the last one, don't even bother with the first two."
Warren Buffet,I never attempt to make money on the stock market. I buy on the assumption that they could close the market the next day and not reopen it for five years.
Warren Buffet,"If you aren't willing to own a stock for 10 years, don't even think about owning it for 10 minutes"
Warren Buffet,"Time is the friend of the wonderful company, the enemy of the mediocre."
Warren Buffet,Buy a stock the way you would buy a house. Understand and like it such that you'd be content to own it in the absence of any market.
Warren Buffet,"You do things when the opportunities come along. I've had periods in my life when I've had a bundle of ideas come along, and I've had long dry spells. If I get an idea next week, I'll do something. If not, I won't do a damn thing."
Warren Buffet,"Opportunities come infrequently. When it rains gold, put out the bucket, not the thimble"
Warren Buffet,You only have to do a very few things right in your life so long as you don't do too many things wrong.
Warren Buffet,It is not necessary to do extraordinary things to get extraordinary results.
Warren Buffet,"What counts for most people in investing is not how much they know, but rather how realistically they define what they don't know."
Warren Buffet,"The key to investing is not assessing how much an industry is going to affect society, or how much it will grow, but rather determining the competitive advantage of any given company and, above all, the durability of that advantage."
Warren Buffet,Stocks of companies selling commodity-like products should come with a warning label: 'Competition may prove hazardous to human wealth.'
Warren Buffet,"Our approach is very much profiting from lack of change rather than from change. With Wrigley chewing gum, it's the lack of change that appeals to me."
Warren Buffet,"Be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful."
Warren Buffet,The most important thing to do if you find yourself in a hole is to stop digging.
Warren Buffet,Risk comes from not knowing what you're doing.
Warren Buffet,Diversification is a protection against ignorance. It makes very little sense for those who know what they're doing.
Warren Buffet,"We've long felt that the only value of stock forecasters is to make fortune tellers look good. Even now, Charlie and I continue to believe that short-term market forecasts are poison and should be kept locked up in a safe place, away from children and also from grown-ups who behave in the market like children."
Warren Buffet,Forecasts may tell you a great deal about the forecaster; they tell you nothing about the future.
Warren Buffet,Nothing sedates rationality like large doses of effortless money.
Warren Buffet,I don't look to jump over 7-foot bars: I look around for 1-foot bars that I can step over.
Warren Buffet,Games are won by players who focus on the playing field -- not by those whose eyes are glued to the scoreboard.
Warren Buffet,"I try to buy stock in businesses that are so wonderful that an idiot can run them because sooner or later, one will."
Warren Buffet,In the long run managements stressing accounting appearance over economic substance usually achieve little of either.
Warren Buffet,"Culture, more than rule books, determines how an organization behaves."
Warren Buffet,"I learned to go into business only with people whom I like, trust, and admire."
Warren Buffet,"In the world of business, the people who are most successful are those who are doing what they love."
Warren Buffet,I'm not interested in cars and my goal is not to make people envious. Don't confuse the cost of living with the standard of living.
Warren Buffet,Life is like a snowball. The important thing is finding wet snow and a really long hill.
Warren Buffet,"You have to keep control of your time, and you can't unless you say no. You can't let people set your agenda in life."
Warren Buffet,The difference between successful people and really successful people is that really successful people say no to almost everything.
Warren Buffet,Writing a check separates a commitment from a conversation.
Warren Buffet,Tell me who your heroes are and I'll tell you how you'll turn out to be.
Warren Buffet,"It takes 20 years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin it. If you think about that, you'll do things differently."
Warren Buffet,"When you get to my age, you'll really measure success in life by how many of the people you want to have love you actually do love you. I know people who have a lot of money, and they get testimonial dinners and they get hospital wings named after them and do all kinds of things. And the truth is that nobody in the world loves them. If you get to my age in life and nobody thinks well of you, I don't care how big your bank account is, it's a disaster."
Warren Buffet,"The best way to think about investments is to be in a room with no one else and to just think. If that doesn't work, nothing else is going to work."
Warren Buffet,What we do is not beyond anybody else's competence. I feel the same way about managing that I do about investing: It's just not necessary to do extraordinary things to get extraordinary results.
Warren Buffet,"I don't know a thing now that I didn't know at 19 when I read [Benjamin Graham's The Intelligent Investor]. For eight years prior to that I was a chartist. I loved all that stuff. I had charts coming out my ears. Then, all of a sudden a fellow explains to me that you don't need all that, just buy something for less than it's worth."
Warren Buffet,I try to stay in games where I have an edge.
Warren Buffet,"If you own a business, and you plow back a good portion of your earnings into building the business, you're going to have something more valuable on average year after year."
Warren Buffet,"Wall street makes its money on activity. You make your money on inactivity. If everybody in this room trades their portfolio around every day with every other person, you're all going to end up broke. The intermediary is going to end up with all the money. On the other hand, if you all own stock in a group of average businesses and just sit here for the next 50 years, you'll end up with a fair amount of money and your broker will be broke. "
Warren Buffet,"For investors as a whole, returns decrease as motion increases."
Warren Buffet,I try to buy a dollar for 60 cents
Warren Buffet,Don't pass up something that's attractive today because you think you will find something way more attractive tomorrow
Warren Buffet,"If you think something is worth a dollar, don't pay 99 cents for it. Buy it at 60 cents so there is a margin of safety. Don't drive up to a bridge that says capacity 10,000 pounds with a 9,900 pound truck and drive across it. Go down the road and find one that says 20,000 pounds."
Warren Buffet,"Whether we're talking about socks or stocks, I like buying quality merchandise when it is marked down."
Warren Buffet,"We never buy something with a price target in mind. We never buy something at 30 saying if it goes to 40 we'll sell it, or 50 or 60 or 100. The way to look at a business is, is this going to keep producing more and more money over time? And if the answer to that is yes, you don't need to ask any more questions."
Warren Buffet,"My successor will need one other particular strength: the ability to fight off the ABCs of business decay, which are arrogance, bureaucracy, and complacency. When these corporate cancers metastasize, even the strongest of companies can falter."
Warren Buffet,"We have a business with very few rules. The only rules the managers have is to basically think like owners. We want those people thinking exactly like they own those businesses themselves. Psychologically, we don't even want them to hink there is a Berkshire Hathaway."
Warren Buffet,We are not in the business of trying to change people. We don't try to change people when we buy the entire business. We think it's like marrying somebody to change them. It just doesn't work very well.
Warren Buffet,I don't have to be smart about everything... I believe in using people who are smarter than I am.
Warren Buffet,"Whenever I read about some company undertaking a cost-cutting program, I know it's not a company that really knows what costs are all about. Spurts don't work in this area. The really good manager does not wake up in the morning and say, ""This is the day I'm going to cut costs"""
Warren Buffet,"I believe enormously in efficiency. I mean, it's the only way living improves, is to get more output per unit of input."
Warren Buffet,"You really have to be very careful in the messages you send as a CEO... If you tell your managers you never want to disappoint Wall Street, and you want to report X per share, you may find that they start fudging figures to protect your predictions."
Warren Buffet,"Usually the managers we hire came with the companies we bought, having demonstrated their talents throughout careers that spanned a wide variety of business circumstances.They were managerial stars long before they knew us, and our main contribution has been to not get in their way. This approach seems elementary: if my job were to manage a golf team - and if Jack Nicklaus or Arnold Palmer were willing to play for me - neither would get a lot of directives from me about how to swing."
Warren Buffet,We don't hire because we get a tax break or because someone in the government tells us to. We hire when there's more demand for what we are making or moving or selling. It's that simple.
Warren Buffet,"What really counts is the presence of a competitive advantage. You want a business with a big castle and a moat around it, and you want that moat to widen over time."
Warren Buffet,"You need a geniune desire, day in, day out, to delight the customer. I've never seen a business - and I've seen a lot of businesses - but I've never seen one that delights the customer that doesn't succeed."
Warren Buffet,"Gillette is marvelous. Gillette supplies over 60 percent of the dollar value of razor blades in the world. When I go to bed at night and I think of all those billions of males sitting there with their hair growing on their faces while I sleep, that can put you to sleep very comfortably."
Warren Buffet,"Be suspicious of companies that trumpet earnings projections and growth expectations. Businesses seldom operate in a tranquil, no-surprise environment, and earnings simply don't advance smoothly"
Warren Buffet,"An Earned Income Tax Credit, I think, is the best way of both guaranteeing that people have a reasonable amount in their pocket even if they're working at jobs where the market... wouldn't pay that much. And it also keeps the dignity of work there. And it also encourages people to improve their skills because as you move up, you keep more of the money."
Warren Buffet,"My instincts are to go along the idea of encouraging individual philanthropy. But I do not believe in giving away other people's money, and so Berkshire Hathaway, at the parent-company level, does not make charitable contributions."
Warren Buffet,"What can be more logical, in whatever you want done, than finding someone better equipped than you are to do it? Who wouldn't select Tiger Woods to take his place in a high-stakes golf game?"
Warren Buffet,It's very important in life to associate with people that are better than you are. And it's the most important decision - you will go in the direction of the people that you associate with.
Warren Buffet,"I spend an inordinate amount of time reading. I probably read at least six hours a day, maybe more. And I spend an hour or two on the telephone. And I think. That's about it."
Warren Buffet,"I do not believe in taking baby steps when you see something that you really understand. I never want to do anything on a small scale because, what's the reason? If I'm doing it on a small scale because I'm not that sure of my opinion, I'll forget it entirely and go on to something I'm sure about."
Albert Einstein,Never give up on what you really want to do. The person with big dreams is more powerful than one with all the facts.
Albert Einstein,Imagination is more important than knowledge. Knowledge is limited. Imagination encircles the world.
Albert Einstein,A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new.
Albert Einstein,I have no special talent. I am only passionately curious.
Albert Einstein,A clever person solves a problem. A wise person avoids it.
Albert Einstein,It is not that I'm so smart. But I stay with the questions much longer.
Albert Einstein,The measure of intelligence is the ability to change.
Albert Einstein,Everything must be made as simple as possible. But not simpler.
Albert Einstein,The best way to cheer yourself is to cheer somebody else up.
Albert Einstein,What is right is not always popular and what is popular is not always right.
Albert Einstein,In the middle of difficulty lies opportunity
Albert Einstein,Blind belief in authority is the greatest enemy of truth.
Albert Einstein,Genius is 1% talent and 99% percent hard work.
Albert Einstein,"Out of clutter, find simplicity."
Albert Einstein,Only those who attempt the absurd can achieve the impossible.
Albert Einstein,If I had an hour to solve a problem I'd spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem and 5 minutes thinking about solutions.
Albert Einstein,Common sense is the collection of prejudices acquired by age eighteen.
Albert Einstein,"One thing I have learned in a long life: that all our science, measured against reality, is primitive and childlike -- and yet it is the most precious thing we have."
Albert Einstein,"Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. He who understands it, earns it ... he who doesn't ... pays it."
Albert Einstein,A student is not a container you have to fill but a torch you have to light up.
Albert Einstein,"At least once a day, allow yourself the freedom to think and dream for yourself."
Charlie Munger,It takes character to sit there with all that cash and do nothing. I didn't get to where I am by going after mediocre opportunities.
Charlie Munger,Recognize reality even when you don't like it. Especially when you don't like it.
Charlie Munger,"You don't have to be brilliant, only a little bit wiser than the other guys, on average, for a long, long, time."
Charlie Munger,Forgetting your mistakes is a terrible error if you are trying to improve your cognition.
Charlie Munger,It never ceases to amaze me to see how much territory can be grasped if one merely masters and consistently uses all the obvious and easily learned principles.
Charlie Munger,"Our job is to find a few intelligent things to do, not to keep up with every damn thing in the world."
Charlie Munger,"Spend each day trying to be a little wiser than you were when you woke up. Day by day, and at the end of the day, if you live long enough ... you will get out of life what you deserve."
Charlie Munger,I never allow myself to have an opinion on anything that I don't know the other side's argument better than they do.
Charlie Munger,I try to get rid of people who always confidently answer questions about which they don't have any real knowledge.
Charlie Munger,Good businesses can survive a little bad management.
Charlie Munger,Trying to prioritize among things we're unlikely to do is pretty fruitless.
Charlie Munger,Show me the incentive and I will show you the outcome.
Charlie Munger,"The way to win is to work, work, work, work and hope to have a few insights. And you're probably not going to be smart enough to find thousands in a lifetime. And when you get a few, you really load up. It's just that simple."
Charlie Munger,"It is remarkable how much long-term advantage people like us have gotten by trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent."
Charlie Munger,People calculate too much and think too little.
Charlie Munger,I did not succeed in life by intelligence. I succeeded because I have a long attention span.
Charlie Munger,We have found in a long life that one competitor is frequently enough to ruin a business.
Charlie Munger,"Why should it be easy to do something that, if done well, two or three times, will make your family rich for life?"
Charlie Munger,"There is an old two-part rule that often works wonders in business, science, and elsewhere: (1) Take a simple, basic idea and (2) take it very seriously."
Charlie Munger,"Step-by-step you get ahead, but not necessarily in fast spurts. But you build discipline by preparing for fast spurts."
Charlie Munger,It makes sense to load up on the very few good insights you have instead of pretending to know everything about everything at all times.
Charlie Munger,"I constantly see people rise in life who are not the smartest, sometimes not even the most diligent. But they are learning machines. They go to bed every night a little wiser than they were that morning."
Charlie Munger,"The more hard lessons you can learn vicariously rather than through your own hard experience, the better."
Charlie Munger,Mimicking the herd invites regression to the mean.
Charlie Munger,You should not only possess wide-ranging elementary wisdom but also go through mental checklist routines in using it. There is no other procedure that will work as well.
Charlie Munger,"You've got to use those tools checklist-style because you'll miss a lot if you just hope that the right tool is going to pop up unaided whenever you need it. But if you've got a full list of tools and go through them in your mind, checklist-style, you will find a lot of answers that you won't find any other way."
Charlie Munger,How can smart people so often be wrong? They don't do what I'm telling you to do: use a checklist to be sure you get all the main models and use them together in a multimodular way.
Charlie Munger,"Invert, always invert,' Jacobi said. He knew that it is in the nature of things that many hard problems are best solved when they are addressed backward ... It is not enough to think problems through forward. You must also think in reverse."
Charlie Munger,"There are huge advantages for the early birds. And when you're an early bird, there's a model that I call 'surfing'--when a surfer gets up and catches the wave and just stays there, he can go a long, long time."
Charlie Munger,The safest way to try to get what you want is to try to deserve what you want. It's such a simple idea. It's the golden rule. You want to deliver to the world what you would buy if you were on the other end.
Benjamin Hardy,"If you're shooting for 2x, you probably won't land much farther from where you are now and you'll exhaust enormous energy grinding inches forward."
Benjamin Hardy,"Working more hours does not equate to better results, but on the contrary, working more hours usually means you're grinding your wheels on not innovating your thinking enough."
Tim Ferris,"Ninety-nine percent of people in the world are convinced they are incapable of achieving great things, so they aim for the mediocre. The level of competition is thus fiercest for 'realistic' goals, paradoxically making them the most time and energy-consuming. It's easier to raise $1,000,000 than it is $100,000. It's easier to pick up the one perfect 10 in the bar than the five 8s."
James Clear,"The difference between good and great is often an extra round of revision. The person who looks things over a second time will appear smarter or more talented, but actually is just polishing things a bit more. Take the time to get it right. Revise it one extra time."
Benjamin Hardy,"To make something 10x better involves deep, deep work. Innovation occurs as you break everything down and put it back together in a simpler, easier, and better form."
Seth Godin,"The rewards are heavily skewed, so much so that it's typical for #1 to get ten times the benefit of #10, and a hundred times the benefit of #100."
Benjamin Hardy,"In all aspects of life, the competition is highest for average goals. Not only is the competition highest, but the excitement is lowest and the pathway forward is dramatically more complex and confusing with small and linear goals. With unrealistic, impossible, or '10x'-level goals, the competition is lowest, the excitement is highest, and the pathway forward becomes simple and non-linear."
Benjamin Hardy,"Furthermore, the 10x thinker is solving a far more nuanced and niched problem. Rather than thinking broadly, they are thinking deeply and narrowly. Theyre deep in their 20 percent and have freed themselves of the cognitive load of the 80 percent. They arent trying to do 100 things decently. Theyre trying to do one thing at a level thats never been seen before."
Richard Koch,Most of what any of us achieve in life of any serious value to ourselves and others actually occurs in a very small proportion of our working lives.
Richard Koch,The key isn't effort. It's finding the right thing to achieve. You are hugely more productive at some things than other things but you dilute the effectiveness of this by doing too many things where your comparative skill is not nearly as great.
Richard Koch,You are more likely to win by rigging the odds in your favor than by striving to improve your performance.
Richard Koch,A lot of people put average effort into too many things rather than superior thought and effort into just a few very important things.
Richard Koch,Strive for excellence in a very few number of things rather than good performance in many of them.
Richard Koch,"Few things really matter, but they matter a tremendous amount."
Richard Koch,"It is not shortage of time that should worry us, but the tendency for the majority of time to be spent in low-quality ways."
Richard Koch,"The 80/20 principle says that if we doubled our time on the top 20% of activities, we could work a two-day week and achieve 60 per cent more than now."
Richard Koch,"Find the place where your name is already inscribed, where you can be intelligent, lazy and highly rewarded."
